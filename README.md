# TSP-Genetic-Algorithm
A genetic algorithm approach to the Traveling Sales Person problem.

There are two different crossover functions as well as two mutation methods. Simply uncomment the one you want to see and comment the other.


# TSP-DFS-BFS
In this solution I solve the Traveling Sales Person problem using DFS and BFS.
This solution is very fast and effective, that is until the input gets very large. That is where the genetic algorithm comes into play.

# TSP-Closest-Edge
In this solution I use a greedy algorithm to solve the TSP problem.
The idea behind this solution is that by using a greedy algorithm, you can get a very good solution, if not the optimal one.
